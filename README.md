# Working-with-Predictive-Data-Analysis
The Machine Learning roadmap


#### Objective
The purpose of the exercise is to demostrate how well we can do predictive analytics.
The process entails how to deal with missing values, different options of converting the categorical data into numbers to make prediction doable.
We will also look at how we can divide the Data into Test and Train, do feature scalling and finally we look at different types of predictive models.
The process will cover these roadmap:

1. B/s understanding
2. Data Understanding
3. Data preparation
4. Modelling
5. Evaluation
6. Deployment
